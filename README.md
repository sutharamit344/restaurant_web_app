Responsive Restaurant Web App
1. Project Overview
The Responsive Restaurant Web App is designed to provide users with an efficient platform for ordering food and booking tables, built entirely with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. The application leverages frontend technologies and local storage to manage user data, creating a seamless experience without relying on a backend server.

2. Technology Stack
HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the application.
JavaScript: Enables dynamic content updates and interactivity.
React: Manages the application state and provides a component-based architecture.
Local Storage: Facilitates persistent data storage across sessions.

4. Architecture
The architecture of the web app follows a component-based structure typical of React applications. Each feature is encapsulated within reusable components:

Header Component: Contains the Logo and navigation bar.
Hero Section Component: Displays promotional content and call-to-action buttons.
Fast Food Showcase Component: Highlights popular fast food and slide using arrow functionality.
Most Served Items Component: Shows dynamically changing menu items on page reload.
Cart Component: Manages the user's selected items, quantities, and subtotal calculations.
Booking Component: Handles table reservation.
Food menu Component: Show menu items.
Footer Component: Contains Logo, Share, quick links and developer contact information.

4. Key Features
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to various screen sizes using CSS media queries and React's responsive design principles, ensuring usability on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Food Ordering System: Users can select items from the menu, manage their cart, and proceed to checkout. The cart functionality includes:
Adding/removing items.
Adjusting quantities.
Viewing the subtotal dynamically.
Table Booking System: Users can reserve tables by selecting a time slot, entering contact details, and confirming their booking with OTP verification.
User Authentication: While not backed by a database, the application includes form validation for sign-up and login processes, ensuring data integrity.
Local Storage: User data, including cart items and bookings, are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing for a persistent experience.
Dark Mode Toggle: A user-friendly toggle to switch between light and dark themes.
Open Graph integration for enhanced social media sharing and SEO.

6. Development Process
I built each feature as a separate component, making it easy to maintain and update. This modular approach enhances reusability and readability.

GitHub Integration
Throughout the development of this project, I utilized GitHub for version control and collaboration. The code repository is hosted on GitHub, which allowed me to manage changes efficiently and maintain the integrity of the project.

6. Challenges and Solutions
Without a backend, managing dynamic data like the "Most Served" items required creative use of JavaScript's built-in capabilities. I implemented a randomization function to select different items on each reload. Implementing real-time validation for user input in forms was challenging but essential. I used JavaScript functions to ensure users received immediate feedback on their input, enhancing the user experience.

7. Conclusion
The Responsive Restaurant Web App showcases my ability to build a full-featured application using modern frontend technologies without a backend. By focusing on a robust user experience and employing best practices in web development, this project serves as a testament to my skills in creating engaging, efficient, and visually appealing web applications.
